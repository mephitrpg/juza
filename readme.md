# Juza - Cloud Storage Aggregator

Juza is a desktop application that lets you merge the space available from multiple cloud storage services into virtual local folders.

It requires that the sync client of each cloud storage service you want to use runs locally too.

Juza manage and distribute the content of the local folders to best fit the space aviable for each remote storage account.

Made with Electron.

Note: due to the fact Juza runs locally on your computer, Juza will download/upload files from/to your cloud storage accounts. Please check your cloud storage services' terms and conditions to know their limits, such as space avaible, bandwidth, file size, etc.
